# School Management API

A Node.js API for managing school data, including adding new schools and retrieving a list of schools sorted by proximity to a user-specified location. This project uses Express.js and MySQL.

## Description

The School Management API allows users to perform the following actions:
- **Add a School:** Add a new school with its name, address, latitude, and longitude to the database.
- **List Schools:** Retrieve a list of schools sorted by proximity to the userâ€™s location, based on latitude and longitude.

## Features

- Node.js with Express.js framework
- MySQL database for storing school data
- Environment variables for configuration management
- Postman collection for easy API testing

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-management-api.git
    cd school-management-api
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up MySQL Database:**

    - Create a MySQL database and a table as described in the "Database Setup" section below.
    - Populate the table with initial data.
## Database Setup

1. Open your MySQL command-line client or MySQL Workbench.
2. Log in to your MySQL server using your root credentials or any other user with sufficient privileges.
3. Create a new database by running the following command:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE school_management;
    ```

**Create the `schools` Table**

Switch to the newly created database and create the `schools` table with the following structure:

```sql
USE school_management;

CREATE TABLE schools (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    latitude FLOAT NOT NULL,
    longitude FLOAT NOT NULL
);
```

4. **Environment Variables:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```bash
    DB_HOST=your-db-host
    DB_USER=your-db-user
    DB_PASS=your-db-password
    DB_NAME=school_management
    PORT=5000
    ```

5. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
